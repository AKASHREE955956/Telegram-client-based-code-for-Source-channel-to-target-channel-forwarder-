# Telegram-client-based-code-for-Source-channel-to-target-channel-forwarder-

I have created all the project via chatgpt 3.5 .
If you are beginner as I am then u can directly use these codes for your work.
Note you have atleast basic knowledge of telegram .
Requirement is api id , api hash and session (telethon,pyrogram or string ).
After that you should run the command via cmd or terminal with active internet connection .
BOOM its worked .
